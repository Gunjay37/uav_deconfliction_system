# Engineering Reflection  
### UAV Deconfliction System  

---

## 1. Technical Growth

This project significantly strengthened my understanding of:

- Airspace safety rules  
- UAV trajectory modeling  
- Spatiotemporal analysis  
- Multilayer visualization  
- Modular robotics software design  
- Engineering-grade documentation standards  

The conflict resolver, in particular, required designing a system that handles both geometric and temporal constraints in a unified way—a technique widely used in real UTM pipelines.

## 2. Engineering Challenges

### 2.1 Designing a Robust Conflict Model  
Ensuring the spatial and temporal logic remained consistent across all drones required:

- Careful interpolation  
- Consistent safety buffer enforcement  
- Deep validation using random airspace generation  

---

### 2.2 Visualization Consistency  
Combining 2D, 3D, and 4D visualizations while maintaining interpretability took careful design.

---

### 2.3 Ensuring Extensibility  
A key learning was structuring software such that new features (e.g., ROS2 input, probabilistic paths, live telemetry) can be added without rewriting the system.

## 3. Outcome

The final system is:

- Modular  
- Extensible  
- Research-grade  
- Professionally documented  
- Highly interpretable visually  

It demonstrates the practical application of robotics, autonomy, and software engineering principles to a domain-critical problem: **UAV airspace safety**.

## 4. Future Scope

- ROS2 integration  
- Live telemetry ingestion  
- Probabilistic conflict modeling  
- Real-world airspace simulations  
- Integration with real-time command & control

## 5. Closing Note

This project reflects the engineering depth, autonomy understanding, and system design maturity expected in advanced robotics roles. It was developed with careful attention to clarity, correctness, and professional presentation.
